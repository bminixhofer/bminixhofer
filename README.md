### Hi, I'm Benjamin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at [JKU Linz](https://www.jku.at/en/degree-programs/types-of-degree-programs/bachelors-and-diploma-degree-programs/ba-artificial-intelligence/). Previously I [worked on Transformers](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard) as ML Research Intern at Huawei.

I am especially interested in everything NLP and in Rust as a language for writing fast, correct code.

Some of my projects:

- [NNSplit](https://bminixhofer.github.io/nnsplit/). A library implementing a general framework for semantic text segmentation.
- [GerPT2](https://github.com/bminixhofer/gerpt2). A small German GPT2 model. I also trained a [large version](https://huggingface.co/benjamin/gerpt2-large).
- [tractjs](https://github.com/bminixhofer/tracjts). A library for running ONNX and TensorFlow models client-side in the browser. Built on the awesome [tract](https://github.com/sonos/tract) library and accessible from Javascript.

I've [also](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/discussion/125436) been [active](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/leaderboard) on Kaggle some time ago.

Feel free to write me an email at bminixhofer at gmail dot com if you'd like to chat about any of the above (or anything else!).
