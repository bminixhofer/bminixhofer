### Hi, I'm Benjamin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at [JKU Linz](https://www.jku.at/en/degree-programs/types-of-degree-programs/bachelors-and-diploma-degree-programs/ba-artificial-intelligence/). Previously I worked as Research Intern on [SOTA Transformers](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard) at Huawei.

I am especially interested in everything NLP and in Rust as a language for writing fast, correct code. I have started programming with web development. Since then I've moved to ML but I'm still fascinated by clean UI / UX and presenting information in an intuitive and *verstÃ¤ndnisfÃ¶rdernd* way. 

Some of my projects:

- [NNSplit](https://bminixhofer.github.io/nnsplit/). A library implementing a general framework for semantic text segmentation. Can be used for sentence boundary detection, compound splitting or tokenization in seven languages with bindings for Rust, Python and Javascript.
- [GerPT2](https://github.com/bminixhofer/gerpt2). A German GPT2 model. I recently quite unexpectedly got access to lots of compute, so I used it to train a German version of GPT2. Available at the [Hugging Face model hub](https://huggingface.co/benjamin/gerpt2). 
- [tractjs](https://github.com/bminixhofer/tractjs). A library for running ONNX and TensorFlow models client-side in the browser. Built on the awesome [tract](https://github.com/sonos/tract) library and accessible from Javascript.

You might also know me from Kaggle. I have been quite active there some time ago, notably with [solo 5th place in the PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/leaderboard) and [finding out the 1st place participant in that competition had cheated](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/discussion/125436). Since then I've not been active on Kaggle but I might return for the right competition ðŸ™‚.

I've been working on self-supervised German text correction with Transformers for some time now, but nothing that is ready to publicize yet.

I'm always happy to get in touch with people, feel free to write me an email at bminixhofer at gmail dot com if you'd like to chat about any of the above (or anything else!).
