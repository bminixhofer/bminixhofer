### Hi, I'm Benjamin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at [JKU Linz](https://www.jku.at/en/degree-programs/types-of-degree-programs/bachelors-and-diploma-degree-programs/ba-artificial-intelligence/). Previously I [worked on simplifying access to state-of-the-art Deep Learning](https://h2o.ai/platform/h2o-hydrogen-torch/) as Data Science Intern at H2O.ai and [worked on Transformers](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.26/) as ML Research Intern at Huawei.

I am especially interested in everything NLP and in Rust as a language for writing fast, correct code.

Some of my projects:

- [WECHSEL](https://github.com/cpjku/wechsel). A method to transfer pretrained language models to a new language.
- [nlprule](https://github.com/bminixhofer/nlprule). A fast, low-resource Natural Language Processing and Error Correction library written in Rust.
- [NNSplit](https://bminixhofer.github.io/nnsplit/). A library implementing a general framework for semantic text segmentation.
- [GerPT2](https://github.com/bminixhofer/gerpt2). A small German GPT2 model. I also trained a [large version](https://huggingface.co/benjamin/gerpt2-large).
- [tractjs](https://github.com/bminixhofer/tractjs). A library for running ONNX and TensorFlow models client-side in the browser. Built on the awesome [tract](https://github.com/sonos/tract) library and accessible from Javascript.

I've [also](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/discussion/125436) [been](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering/leaderboard) [active](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/leaderboard) on Kaggle some time ago.

Feel free to write me an email at bminixhofer at gmail dot com if you'd like to chat about any of the above (or anything else!).
